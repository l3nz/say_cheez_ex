# SayCheezEx ðŸ“¸  

Captures a snapshot of the environment at build time, so you can display it at run-time.

Sometimes you'd want to reference the version of your package at run time, or when / where / from what sources it was built, but that information is not available anymore once you deploy your app somewhere else.

It can also be useful to run a pipeline once when building, e.g. compiling a SASS file into CSS and storing the result as a string.

This library is heavily ispired by my previous (and very useful) Clojure library https://github.com/l3nz/say-cheez

## Installing

Just add to your `mix.exs` file:

        {:say_cheez_ex, "~> 0.1"}

## Using

Whenever you want to reference a version/build information,
create an Elixir attribute for the module and compute its value through SayCheezEx.

I often compute a "short" version number,
an User-Agent for performing HTTP requests,
and a long version that contains the full
build information.

For example:

```
module Foo do
        # v 0.1.1 0123456 87
        @version_short "v #{SayCheezEx.info(:project_version)} #{SayCheezEx.info(:git_commit_id)}
        #{SayCheezEx.info(:build_number)}"
        
        # MyProject-0.1.1
        @user_agent "#{SayCheezEx.info(:project_name)}-#{SayCheezEx.info(:project_version)}"

        ...
end
```

Always make sure that you assign those values to an attibute - **never call those functions directly**.

You can safely create such attributes in all modules that need them, as they are just one (usually very small) binary.

### What is available

- The name of this project, its version, the version of Elixir and OTP
- When the project was built, where was it built and by which user, the build number (if available)
- The current Git SHA that was built, when the last commit was made and by whom.

See https://hexdocs.pm/say_cheez_ex/SayCheezEx.html#info/1 for a full list.

You can also call `SayCheezEx.all()` for a
map with all available attributes:

# Roadmap

- Capture arbitrary environment variables at build time. 
- Display runtime information (memory, cpu) in a compact and handy way
